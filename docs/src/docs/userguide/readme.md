For information about building, installing and running the Influent source code, see the [Development](../../community/developer-docs/) page.

## <a name="examples"></a>Examples ##

The look and feel of each Influent deployment is highly dependent on the source transaction data to which it is configured. While the topics in this help system refer to the interface for a specific dataset (semi-anonymized Kiva microloans), many different configurations are available for the display of account and transaction details, summary icons and clustering properties.

To follow along with the examples or explore the capabilities of Influent, you can access any the following demos:

- For a live demo using the full Kiva dataset, see the [Demos](../../demos) page.
- For a downloadable demo using a subset of the Kiva data, see the [Download](../../community/download) page.<p class="list-paragraph"><strong>NOTE</strong>: This demo requires Java version 1.7 and assumes you know how to run start scripts for your operating system.</p>
- To build the demo directly from the source code, see the [Influent repository](https://github.com/unchartedsoftware/influent/tree/master/kiva) on GitHub. Intended for web developers only. <p class="list-paragraph"><strong>NOTE</strong>: Additional example applications utilizing <a href="https://github.com/unchartedsoftware/influent/tree/master/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a> and <a href="https://github.com/unchartedsoftware/influent/tree/master/walker">email</a> transactions are also available in this repository. As with the Kiva application, these demonstrations are intended for web developers only.</p>
