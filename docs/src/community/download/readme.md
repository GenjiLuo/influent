## <a name="packaged-distribution"></a> Packaged Distribution ##

This demo distribution of Influent includes a subset of the full dataset used by the [Kiva demo](../../demos/#kiva). For developers, this distribution provides a model of how to bundle and configure Influent for a Tomcat web server. For others, it provides the ability to run local demos. 

**NOTE**: This distribution requires Java version 1.7 to be installed on your machine.

To launch the distribution, unzip the file and double-click the appropriate start script for your operating system. Then, access *http://localhost:8080/kiva/* in your web browser.
