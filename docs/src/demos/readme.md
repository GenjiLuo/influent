Influent Demonstrations
=======================

The following demos illustrate how Influent, when applied to large datasets, enables analysts to explore patterns of transactions between entities over time.

## Video ##

The following video walks through a standard Influent workflow process using the Kiva demo described below. It also briefly demonstrates the query by example functionality using a Bitcoin demo, which explores several years of Bitcoin transactions.

The Kiva demo explores a multi-year snapshot of semi-anonymized [Kiva](http://www.kiva.org) microloan data. Kiva is a non-profit organisation that facilitates crowd source funded loans for small entrepreneurs across the globe through its online platform, connecting *borrowers* with local *partners* (financial institutions) and *lenders*.

### Use of Kiva Data ###

To promote lending and in the interests of transparency with respect to any possible fraud concerns Kiva participants agree to share all information publicly, *with the exception of the precise amounts loaned by each lender*. That public data is used here for demonstration purposes only, and with two important differences:

- Any identifying information which lenders chose to publish about themselves publicly on Kiva has been removed, including names.
- Loan amounts have been substituted in for each lender by evenly distributing the total amount loaned between all lenders for that loan.

<span class="disclaimer"><strong>NOTE</strong>: The Kiva demo represents an experimental exercise only, undertaken for the purposes of developing and testing Influent against realistic transaction data (and hopefully highlighting a great organisation in the process!). It may not be used for any other purpose. No warranties are provided as to the accuracy of the data. The authors of Influent are in no way affiliated with the Kiva organisation.</span>
